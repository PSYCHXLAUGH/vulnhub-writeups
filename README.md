# **vulnhub-writeups** üìö

This repository contains my **write-ups** for various **VulnHub** CTF (Capture The Flag) machines, designed to help security enthusiasts and professionals improve their **penetration testing** and **ethical hacking** skills.

VulnHub provides **intentionally vulnerable virtual machines** that allow individuals to practice **security auditing**, **vulnerability exploitation**, and **post-exploitation** techniques in a safe and legal environment. In this repository, I document my process of solving these challenges, which include detailed steps for:

- **Enumeration**: Scanning and identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation**: Using known vulnerabilities and custom techniques to gain access to the target machine.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques to escalate privileges and gain root access.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Maintaining access, gathering sensitive information, and covering tracks.
- **Tips and Tools**: Tools and techniques used throughout the process (e.g., Nmap, Gobuster, Metasploit, Netcat, etc.).

## Key Features:

- **Detailed Step-by-Step Solutions**: Clear explanations of each step taken to solve each VulnHub machine.
- **Security Tools**: The write-ups showcase practical use of industry-standard tools for **network enumeration**, **vulnerability scanning**, **web application attacks**, **local privilege escalation**, and **post-exploitation**.
- **Focus on Learning**: Each write-up is aimed at helping you learn common techniques in the world of **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing**.

## Target Audience üéØ

- **Beginners**: Those just starting out in **cybersecurity** and looking for a structured approach to solving CTF machines.
- **Penetration Testers**: Professionals who want to enhance their practical skills and deepen their understanding of **vulnerability exploitation**.
- **Security Enthusiasts**: Anyone passionate about **ethical hacking** and cybersecurity who enjoys solving security challenges.
